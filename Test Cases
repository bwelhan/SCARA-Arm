Singularity solution: make sure the arm cannot move into a position where the distance 
between joints exceeds 2x the length of arms (ideally 80% of 2x Length).
Can then do a check to see if the new movement will decrease or increase the distance between
the arms. If decrease then movement is allowed. If increase then no movement occurs.

1. Both motors moving in opposite directions
  - Limit motors to not be able to have angles greater than a limit (probably ~45 degrees)
2. Both motors moving towards each other
  - Limit motors to not be able to have angles within ~10-15 degrees of each other
3. Both arms at 45 degrees and freely rotating arms are parallel
  - Don't allow both arms to be at 45 degrees at the same time
