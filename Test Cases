1. Both motors moving in opposite directions
  - Limit motors to not be able to have angles greater than a limit (probably ~45 degrees)
2. Both motors moving towards each other
  - Limit motors to not be able to have angles within ~10-15 degrees of each other
3. Both arms at 45 degrees and freely rotating arms are parallel
  - Don't allow both arms to be at 45 degrees at the same time
